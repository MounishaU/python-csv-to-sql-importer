# Python CSV to SQL Importer

A powerful and intelligent Python tool designed to simplify the process of importing CSV data into SQL databases. This project aims to automate data type inference, handle basic data cleaning, and generate/execute SQL 'CREATE TABLE' and 'INSERT' statements, making data ingestion more efficient.

## Features (Planned)

* Automatic SQL data type inference from CSV columns.
* Generation of 'CREATE TABLE' statements.
* Generation and execution of 'INSERT' statements for data loading.
* Basic handling of missing values.
* Support for various CSV delimiters.
* Command line interface for easy usage.

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas (for data manipulation)
* mysql-connector-python (for MySQL database interaction)
* SQL

## Getting Started (Work in Progress)

* Python 3.x
* A MySQL database instance (local or remote)
